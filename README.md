Tech Stack Justification:
-React: Offers a component-based structure and efficient state management, ideal for building dynamic, interactive UIs.
-React Router: Manages navigation and routing, ensuring smooth page transitions across the app.
-Context API: Handles global state for cart and user data, providing a seamless experience across different pages.
-Baserow: A mock-up database for simple API fetching and testing during development.

Implementation Plan:
-Step 1: Break down the project into key components such as the Header/Footer, HomePage, Shop View, Item View, Login, Checkout, etc., for simpler development and structure.
-Step 2: Set up the app skeleton to configure routing and map routes to the appropriate components.
-Step 3: Identify the data needs for each component. For example, fetching data for the Shop View, managing cart and user state using Context API, etc.
-Step 4: Develop components and integrate CSS using design references for consistent styling.
-Step 5: Test the app locally, ensuring everything works as expected and that itâ€™s responsive across different devices.

Optimization Strategies:
-Backend Optimization: Improve API endpoints for more specific data fetching to reduce load times.
-React Optimization: Use React hooks like useMemo and useCallback to optimize performance and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
-TailwindCSS: Leverage TailwindCSS to speed up development time by using utility classes, ensuring faster styling and responsiveness.
